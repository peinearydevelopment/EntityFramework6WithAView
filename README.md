# How to use a SQL View with Entity Framework 6.1.3

My interest was piqued after reading an [MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt703431.aspx) about a different way to think about the data storage layer of an application.

This project reperesents my first attempt at implementing a way this 'new' data storage technique might be used in relation to Entity Framework.

A big thanks to [Julie Lerman](http://thedatafarm.com/) because after much searching, her article [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn519921) and associated code [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/msdnmag0114) were my windows into how to get this to work.
